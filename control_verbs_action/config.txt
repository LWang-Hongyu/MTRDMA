# RDMA Control Verbs Interception Configuration
# Format lines:
# For resource count based interception: RESOURCE_TYPE MAX_COUNT
# For frequency based interception: VERB_TYPE MAX_FREQUENCY
# Use 0 to disable check
#
# Supported resource types for count-based interception:
# QP_COUNT, PD_COUNT, CQ_COUNT, MR_COUNT
#
# Supported verb types for frequency-based interception:
# QP_CREATE, QP_MODIFY, QP_DESTROY
# PD_ALLOC, PD_DEALLOC
# CQ_CREATE, CQ_DESTROY
# MR_REG, MR_DEREG
# CM_SEND_REQ
# GID_QUERY
#
# Interception Logic:
# Resource count based: When current resource count > MAX_COUNT, intercept CREATE/ALLOC operations but allow DESTROY/DEALLOC
# Frequency based: When verb call rate > MAX_FREQUENCY, intercept the specific verb

# Examples:
# QP_COUNT 1000          # Intercept QP creation when total QP count > 1000
# MR_REG 200             # Intercept MR registration when rate > 200/s
# QP_CREATE 100          # Intercept QP creation when rate > 100/s
